# NiFi CDC Core Project Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The NiFi CDC Core project is a Python-based implementation that leverages Apache NiFi's REST API to create and manage Change Data Capture (CDC) pipelines. Rather than developing custom NiFi processors (NAR files), this project programmatically orchestrates NiFi's built-in processors to implement CDC functionality. The initial focus is on Oracle-to-Oracle database replication with plans to expand to multiple databases and data sources.

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.6+
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - `requests` (2.31.0) - HTTP library for NiFi API communication
  - `python-dotenv` (1.0.0) - Environment variable management
  - `configparser` (6.0.0) - Configuration file parsing
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with comprehensive coverage tools
- **External Requirements**: Apache NiFi 1.28 (deployed separately)

### Core Components

#### 1. NiFi API Client (`src/nifi_api_client.py`)
- Provides a Python wrapper around NiFi's REST API
- Handles authentication via username/password with Bearer token support
- Key functionalities:
  - Process group creation and management
  - Processor instantiation with configurable properties
  - Controller service creation (e.g., DBCPConnectionPool)
  - Connection establishment between processors
  - Processor lifecycle management (start/stop)

#### 2. Configuration Parser (`src/config_parser.py`)
- Manages environment and configuration file parsing
- Reads `.properties` files for datasource and mapping configurations
- Builds JDBC URLs dynamically based on database properties
- Supports environment variable loading via `.env` files

#### 3. CDC Flow Builder (`src/cdc_flow_builder.py`)
- Orchestrates the creation of complete CDC pipelines
- Creates a dedicated process group for each CDC flow
- Instantiates and configures the following NiFi processors:
  - **ExecuteSQL**: Extracts data from source database with CDC conditions
  - **ConvertRecord**: Converts Avro to JSON format
  - **ConvertJSONToSQL**: Transforms JSON to SQL INSERT statements
  - **PutSQL**: Loads data into target database
  - **LogAttribute**: Handles error logging
- Establishes connections between processors with proper error routing

### Configuration Structure

#### Environment Configuration (`.env`)
```
NIFI_API_BASE_URL=http://nifi-host:8080/nifi-api
NIFI_API_USERNAME=admin
NIFI_API_PASSWORD=password
NIFI_ROOT_PROCESS_GROUP_ID=root
NIFI_CDC_PROCESS_GROUP_NAME=CDC-Flows
```

#### Datasource Configuration (`datasources/*.properties`)
```properties
db.type=oracle
db.host=192.168.3.13
db.port=1521
db.service.name=ORCL
db.username=scott
db.password=tiger
```

#### Mapping Configuration (`mappings/*.properties`)
```properties
mapping.name=Test Oracle to Oracle CDC
source.datasource=testdb1
target.datasource=testdb2
source.table=SCOTT.EMP_1
target.table=SCOTT.EMP_2
cdc.column=LAST_UPDATE_TIME
cdc.incremental.from=2025-07-07 15:00:00
cdc.incremental.to=2025-07-07 16:00:00
```

## Key Features

### 1. API-Driven Approach
- No custom NiFi processor development required
- Leverages NiFi's built-in processors via REST API
- Simplifies deployment and maintenance

### 2. Configuration-Based CDC
- Property files define data sources and mappings
- Supports incremental CDC based on timestamp columns
- Flexible batch size configuration

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- 100% test coverage requirement
- Unit tests with mocked dependencies
- Integration tests for end-to-end validation
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology enforced

### 4. Error Handling
- Dedicated error routing for each processor
- Centralized error logging via LogAttribute processor
- Automatic retry mechanisms through NiFi's built-in features

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Configure environment variables
```

### 2. Create CDC Flow
```bash
python create_cdc_flow.py <mapping_name>
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

## Strengths

1. **Clean Architecture**: Well-separated concerns with modular design
2. **API-First Approach**: Avoids complexity of custom NiFi processor development
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% code coverage with TDD methodology
4. **Configuration Flexibility**: Easy to add new data sources and mappings
5. **Production-Ready Error Handling**: Proper error routing and logging

## Areas for Enhancement

1. **Authentication**: Currently supports basic auth; could add certificate-based authentication
2. **Database Support**: Only Oracle is fully implemented; PostgreSQL and others are planned
3. **CDC Strategies**: Currently timestamp-based; could add log-based CDC for supported databases
4. **Monitoring**: Could add metrics collection and alerting capabilities
5. **Flow Templates**: Could create reusable templates for common CDC patterns

## Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**: Passwords stored in plain text in properties files
2. **API Security**: Depends on NiFi's security configuration
3. **Network Security**: No built-in encryption for database connections

## Scalability Considerations

1. **NiFi Clustering**: The design supports NiFi clusters
2. **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for performance tuning
3. **Connection Pooling**: Uses DBCPConnectionPool for efficient database connections
4. **Back Pressure**: Configured with appropriate thresholds (1GB/10000 objects)

## Future Roadmap

Based on the CLAUDE.md documentation, planned expansions include:
1. Multiple database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
2. Additional data sources (FTP, S3, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis)
3. Advanced CDC strategies (log-based replication)
4. Performance monitoring and alerting
5. Flow template library

## Conclusion

The NiFi CDC Core project represents a pragmatic approach to implementing CDC pipelines. By leveraging NiFi's existing capabilities through its REST API, the project avoids the complexity of custom processor development while maintaining flexibility and extensibility. The strong emphasis on testing and configuration-driven design makes it suitable for production environments where reliability and maintainability are critical.
